<b>Bubble sort</a> is the algorithm which sorts the array from lowest to highest value. 

It works in the following manner:
1. Go through the array, one value at a time. Start from first item of the array. 
2. For each value, compare the value with the next value. 
3. If the value is higher than the next one, swap the values so that the highest value goes to the end of the array. 
4. Do this as many times as needed to achieve sorting.
