<b>Linked lists</b> allow to store items anywhere in a memory (or more exactly without sequence). Each item stores the address of the next item in the list as such different memory addressed are liked together. 
The benefits of linked lists are the following:
- They allow to avoid moving items unlike arrays. Consider the following example: array has 4 items, but there are free memory slots in the top row. 
So we need to move array items to another row. This is not efficient.
- They are very good at inserts. In arrays when we add new item to memory, if there are not enough slots, we basically have to move them to another place. 
This is again inefficient. However in linked lists we do not have such an issue, we can add new item easily and this will not require moving it to another memory
slots row.

Disadvatages are the following:
- In order to get to the last item of the list, we need to read all items one by one (because each item contains address/reference to the next item), so that to get to the last item 


In terms of Big O:
Reading O(n). It is because we need to read each item in a linked list, which has reference to another item.
Inserting O(1). It requires constant time. It is because it is easy to change what previous elements points to.
Deleting O(1). It is the same. We just change what item points to

<b>Arrays</b> allow to store collection of items in a contiguous block of memory. They allow to have efficient access to elements using indices (index number). 
Advantages are the following:
- We know every address of an item
- We can easily read any item.

Disadvantages:
- Require moving to another memory slots row if not enough slots.
- Not efficient allocation of memory.

In terms of Big O:
Reading O(1). Because it requires only one operation.
Inserting O(n)
Deletion O(n)
